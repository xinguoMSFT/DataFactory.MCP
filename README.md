# Microsoft Data Factory MCP Server

A Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for Microsoft Data Factory and Azure Fabric Gateway management operations. This server provides tools for authentication and gateway management through a standardized MCP interface.

## Features

- 🔐 **Azure AD Authentication**: Interactive and service principal authentication
- 🌐 **Gateway Management**: List and manage Azure Data Factory gateways
- 🏗️ **Microsoft Fabric Integration**: Support for on-premises, personal, and virtual network gateways
- 📦 **NuGet Distribution**: Available as a NuGet package for easy integration
- 🔧 **MCP Protocol**: Built using the official MCP C# SDK

## Available Tools

- **Authentication**: `authenticate_interactive`, `authenticate_service_principal`, `get_authentication_status`, `get_access_token`, `sign_out`
- **Gateway Management**: `list_gateways`, `get_gateway`

## Quick Start

### Using from NuGet (Recommended)

1. **Configure your IDE**: Create an MCP configuration file in your workspace:

   **VS Code**: Create `.vscode/mcp.json`
   **Visual Studio**: Create `.mcp.json` in solution directory

   ```json
   {
     "servers": {
       "DataFactory.MCP": {
         "type": "stdio",
         "command": "dnx",
         "args": [
           "Microsoft.DataFactory.MCP",
           "--version",
           "0.1.0-beta",
           "--yes"
         ]
       }
     }
   }
   ```

2. **Start using**: The server will be automatically downloaded and available in your IDE's MCP-enabled chat interface.

### Development Setup

To run the server locally during development:

```json
{
  "servers": {
    "DataFactory.MCP": {
      "type": "stdio",
      "command": "dotnet",
      "args": [
        "run",
        "--project",
        "path/to/DataFactory.MCP"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

## Configuration
